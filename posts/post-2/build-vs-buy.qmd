To build or to buy, a question that often comes up - while quantifying the value of a product!

A simple framework to make this choice boils down to thinking about a two questions and having a clarity on the answer that comes up.

- [ ] *Is this component a __necessary__ aspect of your business?*
- [ ] *Is this component __strategic__ to your business?*

#### When to Build?

- Build what is both necessary and strategic. 
- Build what you must do better than anyone else.

#### When to Buy?

- Buy what is necessary and not strategic, ignore everything else.
- Buy what you believe someone else will compound faster than you can.
